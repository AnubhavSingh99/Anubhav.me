        <p>
          i started my coding journey when i was 15, building small games and websites
          just for fun.
        </p>

        <p>
          selling stuff online turned into my high school obsession
          and i grew that into something meaningful by building
          <a href="#"> these</a> and <a href="#"> these</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          been making stuff ever since.
        </p>

        <p>
          most recently, i've been working on <a href="#">buildspace</a> â€” 
          where we help people turn their ideas into reality through code.
        </p>

        <p>
          during this time i built <a href="#">nights & weekends</a>
          reaching over 10,000 developers, created a
          <a href="#"> learning platform</a> for aspiring developers,
          and grew our <a href="#">community</a> to thousands of builders.
        </p>

        <p>
          some stuff above worked out.<br />
          most of it didn't.<br />
          but, i learned a lot.
